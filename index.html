            What Vitruvius Can Teach Us About Web Design

            The ancients can teach us a thing or two about design — even web
            design. The Roman architect Vitruvius had buildings in mind when
            laying out his golden triad, but its principles are just as
            applicable to the web as they are to brick and mortar.
